This is a CLI-based rock paper scissors game with an authentication system. It means you have to log in first before you can play the game on your customized web terminal. The terminal was made with the help of Node child process, WebSocket, and Xterm. If you have admin privileges, then you can access the user management page and delete/block/promote other users to admin. Blocked or deleted users cannot play the game and will have to register again.
